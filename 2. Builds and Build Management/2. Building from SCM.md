- Hands-On
```
Your company is ready to start utilizing the Jenkins server that you installed. The first project that they would like to convert to run on Jenkins is a Maven project from your company's M3 Maven server. This is to replace that server, but projects built there have the instance name hardcoded.

You are to create a project named "mavenproject". This should pull the code from the git repo and build the project. This should include the call to the binary that creates the index.jsp file:

go build bin/makeindex 
The index.jsp file needs to be tracked for version control purposes.
```

Steps :
1) Go to ```manage jenkins -> Global tool configuration -> Add Maven -> Set Name to M3 , choose a version and save configuration```
2) New Item-> FressStyle Project
3) Go to Source code management -> Choose Git -> Paste Repository URL 
4) ``` In build steps choose -> Invoke top level Maven targets ```
